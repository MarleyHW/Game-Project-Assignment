## Description

Tide Rider is a 2D side-scrolling endless runner where you play as a surfer. As the wave speeds up and obstacles increase, players must dodge sea hazards and pull off tricks to stay alive and earn points. The longer you last, the faster and more difficult the game becomes.

The game was inspired by surfing games like YouRiding and Catchin’ Waves from Club Penguin, as well as endless runner games like Jetpack Joyride and Vector.

## How to Play

- Move up and down with the arrow keys  
- Perform tricks using the W, A, S, and D keys (or key combinations)  
- Tricks vary in difficulty and give different point values:
  - Easy trick: 1 second, 5 points
  - Medium trick: 2 seconds, 10 points
  - Hard trick: 3 seconds, 20 points
- Collect seashells for 10 points each  
- Avoid sea obstacles (each hit takes one life)  
- Pick up life jackets to gain extra lives (max 3)

The game gets faster and spawns more obstacles the longer you play.
